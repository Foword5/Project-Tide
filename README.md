# Project Tides
## An app to get information on the tides of different port.
#### Early 2021, IUT de VÃ©lizy, 78 - France

A project I did in group of 2, coded entirely in java, I was working on te back-end while my partner worked on the front-end.

This app contains a calender and a list of port to make your choice from, once you put in a date and a port, you see the informations on the tides that day in that port.

#### Global Update : 2025
Update the code to be maven compatible, plus hard blocking the year to 2021 (instead of current year).    
Done as part of the master thesis, with the objective to change the architecture to hexagonal, and see the benefits and/or limitation of this architecture as well as the challenges encountered when changing.
