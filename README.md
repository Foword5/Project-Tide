#### Early 2021, IUT de VÃ©lizy, 78 - France

A project I did in group of 2, coded entirely in java, I was working on te back-end while my partner worked on the front-end.

This app contains a calender and a list of port to make your choice from, once you put in a date and a port, you see the informations on the tides that day in that port.
